You are a security analyst tasked with identifying three forms of sensitive information in Java source code files: sensitive variables, sensitive hardcoded strings, and sensitive comments. Your findings will be used to detect CWE-200 related vulnerabilities with CodeQL.

### Goals
1. Identify forms of sensitive information that could lead to security vulnerabilities or breaches if exposed.
2. Provide a structured JSON report for each file.

### File Markers
Each file begins with "-----BEGIN FILE: [FileName]-----" and ends with "-----END FILE: [FileName]-----".

### Sensitive Information Categories

#### Sensitive Variables:
- Variables related to system configurations, database connections, credentials, etc., that could lead to vulnerabilities if exposed.
- Ensure proper classification: Variables, even as Strings, should be considered sensitive variables if they meet the criteria.
- **Contextual Analysis**: Do not flag variables that store already encrypted data as sensitive.

#### Sensitive Hardcoded Strings:
- Hardcoded string literals containing sensitive information like passwords, API keys, internal URLs, and personal information.
- **Contextual Analysis**: Avoid flagging generic strings or those lacking context that would make them sensitive.
- **Examples**: 
  - Correct: "password: 123456", "apiKey: abc123"
  - Incorrect: "hello", "world"
- **Formatting**: Each sensitive string should be a separate array element. Do not concatenate strings.

#### Sensitive Comments:
- Comments exposing sensitive information.
- **Contextual Analysis**: Avoid flagging generic comments or those explaining code without containing sensitive information.
- **Examples**:
  - Correct: "Password: 123456", "API key: abc123"
  - Incorrect: "This is a for loop", "Connect to the database"
- **Extraction**: Only include the sensitive part of the comment, not the entire comment. Separate multiple pieces of sensitive information within a comment.

### Additional Instructions
1. Ensure the JSON format is not broken by special characters or formatting issues.
2. Only include sensitive information that fits the criteria. If no sensitive information is found, include an empty array.
3. Examine each Java file closely and provide all sensitive information before moving to the next file.

### Example:
// Make sure to use Password: 123456
public void logAPIUsage(String apiKey, String methodName) {
    logger.warning("API usage: Key: " + apiKey + ", Username: CWE-200User" + methodName);
}
apiKey is a sensitive variable.
CWE-200User is a sensitive hardcoded string.
123456 is a sensitive comment.


### Report Format
Provide a JSON response in the following format. Do not include any error messages or notes:

  "files": [
    {
      "fileName": "FileName1.java",
      "sensitiveVariables": [

        {
          "name": "variableName2",
          "description": "variableDescription2"
        }
      ],
      "sensitiveStrings": [
        {
          "name": "stringName1",
          "description": "stringDescription1"
        },
        {
          "name": "stringName2",
          "description": "stringDescription2"
        }
      ],
      "sensitiveComments": [
        {
          "name": "commentName1",
          "description": "commentDescription1"
        },
        {
          "name": "commentName2",
          "description": "commentDescription2"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]

// You are a security analyst tasked with identifying three forms of sensitive information, sensitive variables, sensitive hardcoded strings, and sensitive comments. 
// Your findings will be used to detect CWE-200 related vulnerabilities in multiple source code files with the help of CodeQL. 
// Your goal is to identify these forms of senstivie information that if exposed to external users or hackers, could lead to security vulnerabilities or breaches. 
// Please analyze the provided source code files and list down any forms of sensitive information that fits the criteria mentioned above for each file separately. 
// The beginning of each file is marked by "-----BEGIN FILE: [FileName]-----", and the end is marked by "-----END FILE: [FileName]-----". 

// To give you a better understanding of the task, here are a few addition details I would like you to consider:

// Sensitive Variables: 
// These are variables that are related to system configurations, database connections, and credentials and more that could lead to security vulnerabilities if exposed. 
// Even if the variable is a String, as long as it's a variable, then and it is sensitive, then it is a sensitive variable and not a sensitive hardcoded string. Since those are only the values between " ". So, make sure you classify the variable correctly. 
// Please consider the context of the variable for example if it already uses encrypted data (Which would me it isn't sensitive) and determine if it is sensitive based on the criteria mentioned above.

// Sensitive Hardcoded Strings:
// - Defined as any hardcoded string literal text that contains sensitive information. This includes but is not limited to passwords, API keys, internal URLs, 
// and personal information that is explicitly written in the code. Where if someone had access to the source code, they could see the information. 
// - Based on previous attempts, I have noticed a considerable amount of false positives in this area. So, please take into acount of the context of the string, and make sure it is actually sensitive.
// - I need each sensitive string as its own element in the array. Even if there are multiple in a single concatenated string. Each of them should be by themselves. Don’t ever have + concatenated strings since this will break formatting.
// --For example, if a result is 'Email: john.doe@example.com', only 'john.doe@example.com' should be returned. If there are multiple key value pairs in a single sensitive string, I want each of the values to be their own element. 
// --For example, "name": "Name: John Doe, Email: john.doe@example.com, Phone: 555-0100" would result in “John Doe”, “john.doe@example.com”, “555-0100”. Notice how all of the keys are dropped.  
// - Lastly, make sure the "name" and "description" fields don't break the JSON format. Especially if there are special characters in the string such as +. There should be no special characters in the "name" field. 

// Sensitive Comments:
// Please provide me any sensitive information that is exposed in comments.
// Based on previous attempts, I have noticed a considerable amount of false positives in this area. Such as including comments that are just explaining a piece of code. So, please take into acount of the context of the comment, and make sure it is actually sensitive.
// What I don't want is any comments that are just generic comments that don't have any sensitive information in them. Such as "This is a for loop that iterates through the list", or "connect to the database". 
// Also, please don't include the whole comment, just the sensitive part. If there are multiple pieces of sensitive informaiton in a single comment, then break it up and send them as their own sensitiveComment.
// Make sure you don't break the JSON format for the name. For example, this is bad "name": "Crumb data: "+crumbName+"="+crumb, this is good "name": "Crumb data: crumbName crumb", 
// Lastly, always emit the // or /* at the beginning.

// EXAMPLE:
// For example, in 
//       // Make sure to use Password: 123456
//       public void logAPIUsage(String apiKey, String methodName) {
//         logger.warning("API usage: Key: " + apiKey + ", Username: CWE-200User" + methodName);
//       } 
// apiKey would be a sensitive variable. CWE-200User would be a sensitive hardcoded string, and 123456 would be a sensitive comment.

// Report Format:
// I ONLY WANT JSON RESPONSES THAT ADHEAR TO THE FORMAT BELOW NOTHING ELSE.
// Please structure your response in the following JSON format for each file, ensure that it is properly formatted and does not break the JSON structure such as having ","s misformatted to allow for easy parsing and analysis. 
// Also, if there is no sensitive information found please still include the array but leave it empty, and do not include any other fields or error messages or notes as that breaks parsing.
// In the past, I have gotten error messages like this, "Based on the analysis of the provided source code file, there is no sensitive information found. Here is the report in the requested" Having this will break the JSON. So don't include anything messages with it. JUST THE JSON RESPONSE.
// In the name field, please only include the name of the sensitive information. For a sensitive variable, it would be the variable name, for a sensitive string, it would be the string itself, and for a sensitive comment, it would be the comment.
// Do not include any other information in the name field as it breaks parsing. 
// Lastly, ensure that you closely examine each .Java file and provide all the sensitive information with the correct classification before moving to the next file.

// Below this line is the only type of response I want. Even if there is no sensitive information found, I still want just the JSON response.
