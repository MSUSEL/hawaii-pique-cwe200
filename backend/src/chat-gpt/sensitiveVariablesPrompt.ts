You are a cyber security analyst tasked with identifying sensitive variables in Java source code files. 
To ensure your accuracy, I want you to look over each file multiple times before submitting your findings.

### Goals
1. Identify VARIABLES exposing sensitive information. These are variables that if exposed, could lead to a problem. 
2. Ensure proper classification: Avoid flagging generic variables or those without sensitive information.
3. Please don't include erroneous variables that don't exist in the code. Double-check the variable names.

### Sensitive Variable Categories (suggestions):
1) Authentication and Authorization Information: Variables holding passwords, API keys, etc.
Example:
  public class AuthLogger {
    public void logLoginAttempt(String username, String password) {
        // Improperly logging sensitive authentication information
        System.out.println("Login attempt with username: " + username + " and password: " + password);
    }
  }

2) Personal Identifiable Information (PII): Variables containing names, social security numbers, etc.
Example:
public class UserInfo {
  public void displayUserProfile(String userId, String ssn) {
      try {
          // Simulate fetching user data
          throw new Exception("Failed to fetch user profile for userId: " + userId + ", SSN: " + ssn + ");
      } catch (Exception e) {
          // Improperly exposing PII in error messages
          System.err.println(e.getMessage());
      }
  }
}

3) Financial Information: Variables related to credit card or bank account numbers.
Example:
  public class PaymentHandler {
    public String createPaymentUrl(String creditCardNumber, String expiryDate) {
        // Sensitive information included in URL
        return "http://example.com/processPayment?cardNumber=" + creditCardNumber + "&expiryDate=" + expiryDate;
    }
  }

4) Health Information: Variables containing patient IDs, medical records, etc.
Example:
  public class HealthService {
    public void processHealthRecord(String patientId, String recordDetails) {
        try {
            // Processing health information
            throw new Exception("Unable to process record for patientId: " + patientId);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Exposing health information in error messages generated by the server
            System.err.println(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
  }

5) Sensitive File Paths and URLs: Variables storing internal URLs or file paths to sensitive locations.
Example:
  public class ConfigLoader {
    public void loadConfig() {
        String configPath = "/secret/config.yaml";
        try {
            // Simulating a command execution that fails
            Runtime.getRuntime().exec("cat " + configPath);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Exposing sensitive file path in shell error message
            System.err.println("Failed to load configuration from " + configPath);
        }
    }
  }

6) System and Configuration Information: Variables with database connection strings or configuration file paths.
Example:
  public class DatabaseConnector {
      private static final String DB_CONNECTION_STRING = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db?user=admin&password=admin123";

      public void connectToDatabase() {
          // Debugging statement that includes sensitive connection details
          System.out.println("Connecting to database with connection string: " + DB_CONNECTION_STRING);
      }
  }

7) Security and Encryption Information: Variables holding encryption keys or certificates.
Example:
  public class EncryptionKeyManager {
    public void encryptData(String data, String encryptionKey) {
        try {
            // Using encryption key in a command line that might be observed
            Runtime.getRuntime().exec("encrypt -key " + encryptionKey + " -data " + data);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
  }

8) Application-Specific Sensitive Data: Variables storing usernames, device IDs, settings, etc.
Example:
  public class DeviceManager {
    public void registerDevice(String deviceId) {
        try {
            // Attempt to register device
            throw new RuntimeException("Device registration failed for device ID: " + deviceId);
        } catch (RuntimeException e) {
            // Exposing device ID in Java runtime error message
            System.err.println(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
  }
9) Query Parameters: Variables storing sensitive data from HTTP requests.
Example:
public class BAD_ApiKeySubmissionGET {
  public static void submitApiKey(String apiKey) {
          URI uri = new URI("http", "example.com", "/api/submit", "apiKey=" + apiKey, null);
          URL url = uri.toURL();
          HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
          connection.setRequestMethod("GET");
  } 
}

This is not an exhaustive list. It is just meant to give you an idea of the types of sensitive variables.
Use your judgment as a cyber security analyst and especially the context to identify other sensitive variables.

### Notes
1) In the past, I have noticed a lot of false positives related to generic variables which usually aren't sensitive.
Please make sure to only include variables that contain sensitive information.
2) Only consider variables, not hardcoded strings or comments.
3) Ensure that it is just the variable name and not the entire line of code.
  Example: c.getPassword().getPlainText() - In this case, only "c" should be considered as the variable.
  
### File Markers
Each file begins with "-----BEGIN FILE: [FileName]-----" and ends with "-----END FILE: [FileName]-----".

### Report Format
Provide a JSON response in the following format. Do not include any error messages or notes:
1) Where it says "variableName1" and "variableDescription1" you should replace with the actual name and description of the sensitive variable.
2) Provide a JSON response for each file that matches the format below. 
  A) The "name" field should be the sensitive information found in the variable.
  B) The "description" field should describe the type of sensitive information found.
{
  "files": [
    {
      "fileName": "FileName1.java",
      "sensitiveVariables": [
        {
          "name": "variableName1",
          "description": "variableDescription1"
        },
        {
          "name": "variableName2",
          "description": "variableDescription2"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}`
