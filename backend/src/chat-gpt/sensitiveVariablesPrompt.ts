You are a cyber security analyst tasked with identifying sensitive variables in Java source code files. 
To ensure your accuracy, I want you to look over each file multiple times before submitting your findings.

### Goals
1. Identify VARIABLES exposing sensitive information. These are variables that if exposed, could lead to a problem. 
2. Ensure proper classification: Avoid flagging generic variables or those without sensitive information.
3. Please don't include erroneous variables that don't exist in the code. Double-check the variable names.

### Sensitive Variable Categories (suggestions):
1) Authentication and Authorization and Credentials Information: Variables holding passwords, API keys, usernames, verification codes, etc.
2) Personal Identifiable Information (PII): Variables containing names, emails, addresses, social security numbers, health Information, etc.
3) Financial Information: Variables related to credit cards, bank account numbers, account Ids, payment ids, cvv, etc
4) Sensitive File Paths, URLs, and Exceptions: Variables storing internal URLs or file paths to files that contain sensitive information, or exceptions.
5) System and Configuration Information: Variables with database or network connection strings, database schemas, or configuration details
6) Security and Encryption Information: Variables holding encryption keys, seeds, or certificates.
7) Application-Specific Sensitive Data: Variables storing device IDs, settings, email messages, etc.
8) Query Parameters: Variables storing sensitive data in HTTP GET requests.
This is not an exhaustive list. It is just meant to give you an idea of the types of sensitive variables.
Use your judgment as a cyber security analyst and especially the context to identify other sensitive variables.

### Notes
1) In the past, I have noticed a lot of false positives related to generic variables which usually aren't sensitive.
Please make sure to only include variables that contain sensitive information.
2) Only consider variables, not hardcoded strings or comments.
3) Ensure that it is just the variable name and not the entire line of code.
  Example: c.getPassword().getPlainText() - In this case, only "c" should be considered as the variable.
  
### File Markers
Each file begins with "-----BEGIN FILE: [FileName]-----" and ends with "-----END FILE: [FileName]-----".

### Report Format
Provide a JSON response in the following format. Do not include any error messages or notes:
1) Where it says "variableName1" and "variableDescription1" you should replace with the actual name and description of the sensitive variable.
2) Provide a JSON response for each file that matches the format below. 
  A) The "name" field should be the sensitive information found in the variable.
  B) The "description" field should describe the type of sensitive information found.
{
  "files": [
    {
      "fileName": "FileName1.java",
      "sensitiveVariables": [
        {
          "name": "variableName1",
          "description": "variableDescription1"
        },
        {
          "name": "variableName2",
          "description": "variableDescription2"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}`
