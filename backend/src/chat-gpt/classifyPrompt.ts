You are a cyber security analyst tasked with classifying Java source code files.
The classifications can be either non-vulnerable or any of these potential CWEs. 

CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy
CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
CWE-214: Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information
CWE-215: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Debugging Code
CWE-531: Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Test Code
CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File
CWE-535: Exposure of Information Through Shell Error Message
CWE-536: Servlet Runtime Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
CWE-537: Java Runtime Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
CWE-540: Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Source Code
CWE-548: Exposure of Information Through Directory Listing
CWE-550: Server-generated Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings
CWE-615: Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Source Code Comments

Due to the overlap of some of these CWEs a file might fall under multiple CWEs and that it fine.

### File Markers
Each file begins with "-----BEGIN FILE: [FileName]-----" and ends with "-----END FILE: [FileName]-----".

### Report Format
Provide a JSON response in the following format. Do not include any error messages or notes:
1) Where it says "cwe" and "cweDescription" you should replace with the actual CWE name (Just the ID, not the whole name) and a description for why this file has that CWE.
2) Provide a JSON response for each file that matches the format below. 
  A) The "name" field should be the CWE found in the file or non-vulnerable if there isn't one.
  B) The "description" field should describe the reason for this classification.

  "files": [
    {
      "fileName": "FileName1.java",
      "classification": [
        {
          "name": "cwe1",
          "description": "cweDescription1"
        },
        {
        "name": "cwe2",
        "description": "cweDescription2"
        }
