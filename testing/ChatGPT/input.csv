CVE-2020-15250,CWE-200,Junit » Junit4 Versions from including (>=) 4.7 and before (<) 4.13.1,"API Keys, Passwords","In JUnit4 from version 4.7 and before 4.13.1, the test rule TemporaryFolder contains a local information disclosure vulnerability. On Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. Because of this, when files and directories are written into this directory they are, by default, readable by other users on that same system. This vulnerability does not allow other users to overwrite the contents of these directories or files. This is purely an information disclosure vulnerability. This vulnerability impacts you if the JUnit tests write sensitive information, like API keys or passwords, into the temporary folder, and the JUnit tests execute in an environment where the OS has other untrusted users. Because certain JDK file system APIs were only added in JDK 1.7, this this fix is dependent upon the version of the JDK you are using. For Java 1.7 and higher users: this vulnerability is fixed in 4.13.1. For Java 1.6 and lower users: no patch is available, you must use the workaround below. If you are unable to patch, or are stuck running on Java 1.6, specifying the `java.io.tmpdir` system environment variable to a directory that is exclusively owned by the executing user will fix this vulnerability.

CVE-2023-28630,CWE-532,Thoughtworks » Gocd Versions from including (>=) 20.5.0 and before (<) 23.1.0,Credentials,"GoCD is an open source continuous delivery server. In GoCD versions from 20.5.0 and below 23.1.0, if the server environment is not correctly configured by administrators to provide access to the relevant PostgreSQL or MySQL backup tools, the credentials for database access may be unintentionally leaked to admin alerts on the GoCD user interface. The vulnerability is triggered only if the GoCD server host is misconfigured to have backups enabled, but does not have access to the `pg_dump` or `mysqldump` utility tools to backup the configured database type (PostgreSQL or MySQL respectively). In such cases, failure to launch the expected backup utility reports the shell environment used to attempt to launch in the server admin alert, which includes the plaintext database password supplied to the configured tool. This vulnerability does not affect backups of the default on-disk H2 database that GoCD is configured to use. This issue has been addressed and fixed in GoCD 23.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable backups, or administrators should ensure that the required `pg_dump` (PostgreSQL) or `mysqldump` (MySQL) binaries are available on the GoCD server when backups are triggered.",https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/6545481e7b36817dd6033bf614585a8db242070d,https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/6545481e7b36817dd6033bf614585a8db242070d/db-support/db-support-mysql/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/server/database/mysql/MySQLBackupProcessor.java,"""targetDir"", ""dataSource"", ""dbProperties?"", ""processResult"", ""url"", ""connectionUrlInstance?"", ""env?"", ""argv"", """"",,,,MySQLBackupProcessor.java,,,,,,,,,
