This approach is inspired by techniques from computer vision, specifically the use of **masked autoencoders (MAE)** 
for self-supervised learning. In vision tasks, MAE-style models mask large portions of an image (e.g., 75% of patches) 
and train the model to reconstruct the missing parts. This leads to robust representations that generalize well 
with limited supervision.

In the context of text/code data, we apply a similar idea using **ELECTRA** 
(https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10555), which replaces the traditional masked language modeling objective used in BERT 
with a **replaced-token detection** task. Instead of predicting masked tokens, ELECTRA learns to distinguish 
between original and replaced tokens across the entire sequence.

This discriminator-based objective provides a stronger training signal and leads to more efficient pre-training. 
As a result, ELECTRA-style models often outperform BERT-like models on classification tasks, especially when labeled data 
is limited. In our case, ELECTRA embeddings are used to represent variable names and their code context, 
which are then passed to a classifier to predict whether the data is sensitive.
